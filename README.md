# Sales-Comparisons-By-Region


I completed a project that involved creating a dashboard to visualize and compare sales data between two selected regions for a leading organization. Using the Sample Superstore dataset, I organized the data by customer name and order ID, created a location hierarchy, and developed parameters for the primary and secondary regions of interest. <br>

I calculated the first order date for each region and built a dashboard that displayed key metrics including total sales, average sales per order, number of customers, number of orders, and number of products in sale. The dashboard effectively showcased the performance and insights of the two regions side by side. <br>

By aligning all the sheets and partitioning the dashboard, I presented a clear and concise overview of the sales comparison between the primary and secondary regions. The project demonstrated my proficiency in data visualization using Tableau and my ability to analyze and present data in a meaningful way to support decision-making. <br>

Overall, this project showcases my skills in creating interactive dashboards, utilizing parameters and calculated fields, and effectively communicating sales insights through visualizations. <br>
